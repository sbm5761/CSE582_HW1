# CSE582_HW1

Included in this repository is the word2vec.c file in which I read through and made comments about my understanding of how the code works and 
how it calculates the word embeddings from CBOW and Skipgram.

I also included screenshots of the top 10 words that are most similar to 'cat', 'she', and 'like' that is computed based on cosine distance.
